# Minder

Minder is a simple and intuitive task organizer that allows you to easily create lists for your everyday tasks.  You can schedule tasks for specific dates in the future, and create repeating alarms for items that you do on a regular basis.  Many options are customizable, and your tasks can be sorted manually, alphabetically or by date to better organize your list.
